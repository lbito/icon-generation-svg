# icon-generation-svg

**Introduction**  

The aim of this project is to generate vector graphic representations of icons. To achieve this goal we propose a preprocessing step of detecting bounded vector approximations of raster images. This vectorised dataset will become the training set for the discriminator component of the GAN for generating new icons. This form of dimensionality reduction may improve the stability of the GAN during training.
